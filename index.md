## Values

- **Learning** is probably my biggest value. I think that knowledge is power and a lot of the time knowledge can lead you to whatever it is you wish to accomplish in life. I actively try to seek out learning opportunities for myself in all sorts of things.

- **Authenticity** is something I really value. I think everyone needs to be able to express themselves as they are to be happy. Authenticity over originality is a common saying I like.

- **Friendship** I love being around good people.

## Personality

- **Curious** is probably the biggest trait of my personality. I love to ask questions and learn what I can about all sorts of random things in the world.

- **Fun** I love goofing off (on my own time of course). I don't think life should be taken to seriously and that your attitude can turn a bad situation into a good one if you're willing to laugh and make the most of something.

- **Impatient** I like fast moving things and can easily lose focus if I find something slow or boring.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- I like my feedback to be straight up weather it be positive or negative. I dont love when people beat around the bush with feadback. The more direct and focused the better.

- I dont mind if my feedback is given in public or private, this goes for positive or negative feedback. If there's a lot of something though a 1:1 or direct message is probably most appropriate as to not bog down any meeting or channel.

- I like feedback to be dialogue rather than ending on a air-drop of a comment.

What about when one of us wants to call you out in some way for something awesome you did, a
great piece of advice you gave, an insight you had, or your amazing Cat Thursday shirt—how do
you feel most comfortable receiving that recognition?

## Work Patterns

- I like to work with other people but can struggle when/if I'm put on the spot for something so I ususally dont prefer pairing. An alternative that works well for me is to be given a task to complete on my own time and then come back to teach or explain whatever was assigned. I'd like to get better being in pairs while I'm here so this is something I'd like to work towards changing.

- I do love pairing when I'm being taught something. Watching someone code while I try to learn whatever tech they are using works great for me.

## Communication Preferences

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

- When I'm quiet. If I understand something I'm always repeating things back and staying vocal. I get quiet when I **fear I am unable to learn something, confused to an extreme level**. I usually speak up when I'm confused and ask questions but this is the dark side we're talking about so its bad when I'm quiet.

### How to help

- Some time alone helps me to clear my head and reset so I can look at something with a fresh prespective and an uncluttered brain.
- Can never go wrong with some 1:1 time!

## Me Being Me

- Eye contact on zoom specifically. I find it pretty draining to hold consistent eye contact on zoom so if my eyes drift away on a call, I'm still there and listening.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

- I'm still very early in my career so short-medium term goals would be to graduate and become a fulltime software engineer.

- Explore more areas of tech. I wanna try it all.

## Areas for Development

- Every single thing imaginable. I'm young, I'm an intern, I'm here to try, fail, and learn. With my limited professional expierence I still have so much to develop. Because of this **feedback in any and all areas is strongly encouraged**.

## Ask Me About

- Santa Cruz, where I grew up! I know a lot of us Pantheors go there for long weekends or a beach day and I would love to be your travel agent and put you in the know of some great spots or resturants. I'm full of recommendations.

- Food. Love to eat it, love to cook it, love to talk about it.

- Anything outdoorsy! I love to hike, bike, surf, camp and would love to talk to about anything related.

- All things cryptocurrency related.
